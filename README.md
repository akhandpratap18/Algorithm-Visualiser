## Project Description

The Algorithm Visualizer is designed to make understanding sorting algorithms easier through an interactive, real-time visual representation. Users can choose different sorting algorithms and visualize how data is manipulated at each step, making the learning process engaging and intuitive.

Key features:
1. **Interactive UI:** Start and pause the algorithm at any point.
2. **Algorithm Selection:** Choose from different sorting algorithms.
3. **Step-by-Step Visualization:** Watch each algorithm sort the array in real time.
4. **Custom Input:** Change the size and speed of the input for a more tailored experience.
